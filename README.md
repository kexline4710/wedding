# Wedding App

My intention is for this to be a boilerplate wedding app.

## To Do

- [ ] Create events that have date, time, and address
- [ ] Displays basic event information
- [ ] Create guests that store name, contact information, rsvp status, and meal selection
- [ ] Create users with admin/non-admin roles
- [ ] Login/admin functionality for bride and groom
- [ ] Implement import/export to see guest list
- [ ] Send email to guest and admins after an RSVP

## Random Thoughts

* Maybe check out Gulp instead of Grunt? This [gulp-rails-pipeline](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-rails-pipeline) looks interesting. Ugh, front end hurtz.
* I really like this [wedding icon set](http://www.flaticon.com/packs/wedding-7).
