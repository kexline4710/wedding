# Wedding App

My intention is for this to be a boilerplate wedding app.

## To Do

- [ ] Create events that have date, time, and address
- [ ] Displays basic event information
- [ ] Create guests that store name, contact information, rsvp status, and meal selection
- [ ] Create users with admin/non-admin roles
- [ ] Login/admin functionality for bride and groom
- [ ] Implement import/export to see guest list
- [ ] Send email to guest and admins after an RSVP
